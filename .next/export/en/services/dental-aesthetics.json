In other words, cosmetic dentistry is a branch of dentistry that focuses on improving both the function and appearance of a person's teeth. Any actions taken to achieve healthy and attractive teeth, such as bleaching, cleaning, and polishing, fall under the category of cosmetic dentistry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","description2":"<h2>Teeth Whitening for Aesthetic Purposes</h2>\n<h6>Teeth whitening is an effective method for enhancing the appearance of teeth. Bleaching, which can be done both at home and in a clinic, is one such method. When performed in a dental clinic, there are different approaches for live teeth (completely healthy teeth) and non-living teeth (damaged teeth).</h6>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>which include:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Whitening Live Teeth in the Dental Clinic:</strong></p>\n<p>At Dr. Ebadian&rsquo;s clinic, the procedure begins by applying a thick 40% hydrogen peroxide solution to the teeth for a few minutes. Next, the teeth are exposed to laser light or special lamps, which enhances the effectiveness of the whitening agent. This teeth whitening process should be repeated 3 to 4 times, with a one-week interval between each session.</p>\n<p><strong>Whitening Non-Vital or Restored Teeth in the Clinic:</strong></p>\n<p>For this procedure, a cavity is created in the tooth to accommodate the whitening gel. The gel is left inside the tooth for one hour before being removed. Similar to the treatment for live teeth, this method should be repeated 3 to 4 times, with a one-week interval between each session, to achieve visible results.</p>\n<p><strong>Dental Cleaning</strong></p>\n<p>The buildup of plaque and bacteria on teeth can lead to stains and discoloration. Dental cleaning involves a dentist removing plaque and debris from the teeth using specialized cleaning tools. This process helps reduce bacterial penetration into the teeth and lowers the risk of tooth decay.</p>\n<p>However, dental cleaning cannot remove internal stains. For deep stains, other methods such as bleaching are necessary to enhance the appearance of your teeth.</p>\n<p>Dental cleaning can be performed in two ways: manually or with an ultrasonic device. To learn more about the dental cleaning process, its side effects, and aftercare, please visit the dental cleaning page.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Tooth Polishing</strong></p>\n<p>Another process that enhances the beauty of teeth is polishing. The dentist begins by cleaning the surface of the teeth with a brush, then removes plaque and tartar using a special paste called prophylaxis paste, resulting in a smooth surface. As shown in the picture below (before and after tooth polishing), this method is suitable only for teeth with surface stains. Tooth polishing has various types and serves different purposes, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Surface polishing</li>\n<li>Therapeutic polishing</li>\n<li>Cosmetic polishing</li>\n<li>Selective polishing</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Types of Dental Cosmetic Procedures</strong></p>\n<p>Ultimately, all procedures performed in a dental clinic aim to beautify your teeth and smile, such as orthodontics, laminates, implants, and more. Dr. Ebadian&rsquo;s dental clinic can help you achieve the most beautiful smiles in the shortest possible time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","description3":"<p><strong>Laminates and Their Lifespan</strong></p>\n<p>Laminates are a popular dental covering that has proven effective for many years. Many people worldwide use this cosmetic dental procedure to achieve beautiful, white, and well-shaped teeth. Laminates can effectively conceal cracks, misshapen teeth, and yellow or black stains, enhancing the overall appearance of your teeth. However, if someone is not satisfied with the results of laminates or wishes to remove them for any reason, what should be done? The first thought that comes to mind is probably removing the dental laminates.</p>\n<p>Since laminates are external additions to the body, they have a limited lifespan. Although this lifespan can sometimes approach ten years, laminates may deteriorate over time, diminishing the teeth's appearance. The lifespan of laminates depends on numerous factors, with the precision of their fabrication being just one of them.</p>\n<p>The most crucial factor in extending the lifespan of laminates is proper care. This includes avoiding substances such as cigarettes and alcohol, not biting hard materials, refraining from consuming very hot or cold drinks, and regularly using a toothbrush and dental floss, ideally two to three times a day. However, even with these precautions, laminates can still encounter problems. Consequently, many people wonder if laminates cause tooth decay.</p>\n<p>The truth is that tooth decay does not solely depend on the presence of laminates. Some people mistakenly believe that laminates are as strong as natural teeth and test them by biting hard objects. Laminates are primarily a cosmetic dental procedure that makes your teeth look natural but does not necessarily enhance their strength. Therefore, if you have used laminates incorrectly, the issue may not be with the laminates themselves. It is also normal for laminates to chip or decay after a few years.</p>"},"insertDate":"2024-06-02T13:41:17.338Z","updateDate":"2024-07-08T09:16:36.736Z"}},"__N_SSG":true}
