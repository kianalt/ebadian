They have gained popularity due to their unique features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Natural Beauty:</strong> Ceramic veneers offer a highly natural look due to their color and texture, mimicking real teeth effectively.</li>\n<li><strong>High Durability:</strong> These veneers resist stains and discoloration better than other types and can maintain their appearance for years without needing replacement.</li>\n<li><strong>Minimal Invasion:</strong> Installing ceramic veneers requires minimal tooth reduction, preserving the natural structure of your teeth.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>The cost of ceramic veneers</strong> is generally higher than other types, but their durability and aesthetic benefits often make them a worthwhile investment.</p>\n<h2><strong>Composite Veneers:</strong></h2>\n<p><strong> Affordable and Fast Option</strong></p>\n<p>Composite veneers are resin-based materials applied directly to the teeth and can be shaped and adjusted immediately.
