When gums suffer from disease or asymmetry, not only does the appearance of your smile deteriorate, but the health of your teeth is also compromised. Gum surgery can be a solution to these problems, restoring balance to your mouth and teeth.</p>\n<div class=\"mt-1 flex gap-3 empty:hidden juice:-ml-3\">\n<div class=\"items-center justify-start rounded-xl p-1 flex\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>","description2":"<h2><strong>When Do You Need Gum Surgery?</strong></h2>\n<p>Imagine that every time you brush your teeth, your gums bleed. Or when you talk and smile, your gums are overly exposed, causing a drop in your confidence. These are signs that you might need gum surgery. Some of the most common reasons for needing gum surgery include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gum Diseases:</strong> Such as gingivitis (gum inflammation) or periodontitis (advanced gum disease), which damage the gum tissue and the bone around the teeth.</li>\n<li><strong>Excessive Gum Exposure:</strong> If your gums are overly covering your teeth or are too exposed when you smile, gum surgery can correct this.</li>\n<li><strong>Prevention of Further Damage:</strong> If your gums have receded or detached from the teeth, gum surgery can prevent further damage and maintain the health of your mouth and teeth.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"mt-1 flex gap-3 empty:hidden juice:-ml-3\">\n<div class=\"items-center justify-start rounded-xl p-1 flex\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>Types of Gum Surgeries</strong></h2>\n<p>Depending on the type of gum problem, gum surgeries are divided into two main categories: therapeutic and cosmetic gum surgeries.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Therapeutic Gum Surgeries:</strong></li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flap Surgery:</strong> This method is usually used to treat periodontitis. In this surgery, the gums are lifted from the teeth, and after thoroughly cleaning the plaque and bacteria from the tooth roots, they are repositioned.</li>\n<li><strong>Gum Grafting:</strong> This method involves taking gum tissue from other parts of the mouth or using synthetic materials to cover and strengthen the damaged gum areas.</li>\n<li><strong>Bone Grafting:</strong> Used to rebuild jawbone lost due to disease or trauma. This surgery can help preserve and strengthen the structure of the teeth.</li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong>Cosmetic Gum Surgeries:</strong></li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gingivectomy:</strong> This method is used to reshape and align the gums, improving the appearance of your smile. Overgrown gums that cause an unattractive smile are trimmed and shaped in this procedure.</li>\n<li><strong>Gummy Smile Surgery:</strong> This surgery reduces excessive gum visibility when smiling, significantly enhancing the smile&rsquo;s appearance.</li>\n</ul>\n</ol>\n<h2><strong>Factors Affecting the Cost of Gum Surgery</strong></h2>\n<p>One of the most common questions patients have is the cost of gum surgery. The cost depends on various factors, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Type of Surgery:</strong> Whether the surgery is therapeutic or cosmetic affects the cost. Therapeutic surgeries often cost more due to the complexity and the need for special materials.</li>\n<li><strong>Surgeon&rsquo;s Expertise:</strong> The experience and specialization of the dentist significantly impact the final cost. More experienced surgeons with advanced specializations typically charge more.</li>\n<li><strong>Materials and Equipment Used:</strong> The use of special materials like grafting materials or advanced surgical equipment can increase the costs.</li>\n<li><strong>Location of the Clinic:</strong> The clinic&rsquo;s location is also a factor. Clinics in different urban areas may have varying costs.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Post-Gum Surgery Care</strong></p>\n<p>After undergoing gum surgery, following the dentist&rsquo;s recommendations is crucial to achieving the best results and speeding up recovery. Here are some important post-surgery care tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Medication:</strong> Regularly take the medications prescribed by your dentist to reduce pain and prevent infection.</li>\n<li><strong>Care for the Surgical Site:</strong> Avoid applying pressure to the surgical area, and use soft-bristled toothbrushes and mild toothpaste for cleaning.</li>\n<li><strong>Diet:</strong> In the initial days after surgery, stick to soft foods and liquids, and avoid hard, spicy, and hot foods.</li>\n<li><strong>Regular Dental Visits:</strong> Post-surgery follow-ups with the dentist are essential to assess healing progress and make necessary adjustments.</li>\n</ul>","description3":"<h2><strong>Why Choose Dr. Ebadian for Gum Surgery?</strong></h2>\n<p>Choosing a dentist for gum surgery is of utmost importance.
