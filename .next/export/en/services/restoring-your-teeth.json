When teeth develop decay, they require restoration. Restoration is a process in which the damaged or decayed part of the tooth is removed and replaced with specialized filling materials, such as composites, that can function like natural tooth tissue. These materials must possess certain characteristics to be suitable for replacing tooth structure. Tooth decay can vary in severity. Initially, decay affects a small portion of the tooth, which, if left untreated, can spread. If the decay advances, it may necessitate more complex treatments beyond simple restorative procedures.</p>\n<p>Each tooth has multiple surfaces and a volume, and decay typically affects a specific area on one side of the tooth. It is unnecessary to treat all surfaces; only the damaged portion needs restoration.</p>\n<p>Various treatments may be recommended for tooth damage, which we will discuss further in this article.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","description2":"<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Restorative Treatments for Tooth Decay</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Restorative treatments for tooth decay can vary depending on the severity of the decay. If the decay is severe and reaches the root, a root canal treatment may be necessary. In some cases, if the damage is extensive, the tooth may need to be extracted and replaced with an implant. However, if the decay is in its early stages, it can be treated with restorative procedures using various materials.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Amalgam</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Tooth restoration using amalgam is a direct method. Amalgam is a flexible and strong material, though it is not tooth-colored and usually appears silver or black. Amalgam has the highest durability among restorative materials and is less expensive than composites. Its composition includes silver, tin, nickel, and mercury. Due to mercury's toxicity, the use of amalgam has been prohibited in some countries like those in Scandinavia. This treatment has become obsolete due to the health risks associated with mercury exposure.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Composite</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Tooth restoration using composite is also a direct method. Composites are resin-based and paste-like materials made from various fillers, and they come in different types depending on their application. The color of composite can match the rest of a person&rsquo;s teeth and comes in various shades. You can consult with your dentist to determine which composite color is suitable for you. These materials have a natural appearance due to their tooth-like color. The lifespan of composites is shorter compared to other methods. Nowadays, ceramics are used as constituent materials in composites, increasing their durability and providing a more natural appearance. This treatment is the most popular and is considered the most appropriate method for tooth restoration. However, no treatment is completely definitive.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Ceramic Resins</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In this method, an impression of the teeth is taken, and based on that impression, the laboratory creates replacement parts for the decaye portions of your teeth. If the inner part of the tooth is decayed and only the inner portion is filled with ceramic materials, it is called an inlay. If the decay is on the outer part of the tooth, it is called an onlay. This method is usually used for extensive restorations because it involves a larger portion of the tooth. These ceramic fillings match the color of the tooth and have a natural appearance.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">These materials can be applied using two methods: direct and indirect. Direct methods are performed directly by the dentist, while indirect methods, such as those involving composite resins, are done using a laboratory. In the indirect method, an impression of your tooth is taken, sent to the laboratory, and the restoration is fabricated for you.</p>\n<div class=\"flex-1 overflow-hidden\">\n<div class=\"h-full\">\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-otmzj-79elbk h-full\">\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-otmzj-1n7m0yu\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-col text-sm md:pb-9\">\n<div class=\"w-full text-token-text-primary\" dir=\"auto\" data-testid=\"conversation-turn-5\" data-scroll-anchor=\"true\">\n<div class=\"py-2 juice:py-[18px] px-3 text-base md:px-4 m-auto md:px-5 lg:px-1 xl:px-5\">\n<div class=\"mx-auto flex flex-1 gap-3 text-base juice:gap-4 juice:md:gap-5 juice:lg:gap-6 md:max-w-3xl lg:max-w-[40rem] xl:max-w-[48rem]\">\n<div class=\"group/conversation-turn relative flex w-full min-w-0 flex-col agent-turn\">\n<div class=\"flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] text-message flex flex-col items-start whitespace-pre-wrap break-words [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-5 juice:w-full juice:items-end overflow-x-auto gap-2\" dir=\"auto\" data-message-author-role=\"assistant\" data-message-id=\"4792b052-16fc-4f12-953b-edc7b3b39083\">\n<div class=\"flex w-full flex-col gap-1 juice:empty:hidden juice:first:pt-[3px]\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light\">\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2>Signs of Tooth Decay:</h2>\n<p>Tooth decay and cavities present various symptoms, and we have listed the most common ones below.

However, this is a misconception. Dentists recommend that post-restoration care should be even more rigorous. The more consistent and meticulous these care practices are, the longer the lifespan of the materials used in the dental restoration. It is important to note that sugary foods and carbonated beverages contribute to the deterioration and recurrence of tooth decay. Additionally, smoking and alcohol exacerbate tooth decay.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">You can get your teeth restored at any reputable dental clinic. However, it is advisable to undergo a thorough examination of your teeth first to assess their overall condition and choose the best treatment option. Dr. Abadian Dental Clinic is one of the best centers that provides comprehensive information to patients about the treatment process before performing any dental restorations. Patients receive necessary counseling from their dentist in a calm environment and start the treatment process fully informed</p>"},"insertDate":"2024-06-09T11:18:24.724Z","updateDate":"2024-07-07T13:05:26.123Z"}},"__N_SSG":true}
