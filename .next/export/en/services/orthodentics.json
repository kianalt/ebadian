It is one of the most popular dental treatments due to its aesthetic and therapeutic benefits. This treatment is recommended when teeth are irregularly positioned next to each other. Orthodontic treatment is not a quick process, and although there are faster methods to correct misaligned teeth, orthodontics is considered the most thorough and systematic approach. One of the key advantages of orthodontics over other treatments is that it corrects dental malocclusions naturally, without the need for cutting the teeth or using foreign substances. For example, using composites or laminates to correct dental irregularities involves trimming the teeth and placing a foreign material on them.</p>","description2":"<h2>How is Orthodontics Done?</h2>\n<p>To determine if you are a suitable candidate for orthodontics, a specialist must perform a diagnosis. Initially, it is important to identify your specific dental issue. If you have dental malformations or concerns about tooth color, laminates might be the best treatment for you since orthodontics does not change the shape or color of teeth, but rather improves their alignment. Therefore, correctly diagnosing your problem is the first step. If you have misaligned teeth and also issues with dental malformations or tooth color, a combination treatment involving orthodontics and laminates, or orthodontics and bleaching (to correct tooth color), may be necessary. Consult your specialist dentist for the best advice.</p>\n<p>If you suspect that you have crooked or misaligned teeth that require orthodontic treatment, your first step should be to visit an orthodontic or specialized dental clinic. After discussing your concerns with a specialist, the orthodontic treatment process will begin. The specific treatment plan will vary for each person.</p>\n<p>Initially, the orthodontic specialist will examine your teeth and prescribe radiology images. These radiographs will provide a comprehensive set of images needed for assessment, including views of all teeth, individual teeth, canines, and posterior teeth.</p>\n<p>Once the radiography is complete, the specialist will determine the appropriate type of orthodontic treatment based on the examination. For instance, you might be prescribed &ldquo;fixed orthodontic treatment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The next step involves creating orthodontic molds of your teeth, which are then sent to a laboratory to fabricate the brackets. Orthodontic brackets are essential tools for the treatment, helping to align and straighten your teeth.</p>\n<p>Finally, the orthodontic brackets are installed on your teeth.</p>\n<p>After the installation, periodic checkups are required to monitor the braces and the progress of the treatment. Post-orthodontic care is crucial and often more important than the in-clinic treatment stages. Orthodontic treatment is a long-term process that requires patience. Following the specialist&rsquo;s instructions is vital for success. For example, using dental floss and brushing after every meal are essential practices during this period. Ignoring the doctor&rsquo;s advice can negatively impact your treatment plan.</p>","description3":"<h2>Orthodontics for Children</h2>\n<p>Orthodontics is highly suitable for children who are in the growth phase and exhibit signs of dental irregularities. It is beneficial for children to address any irregularities in their teeth as early as possible. Young children should visit a specialist for a dental examination, and if needed, a comprehensive treatment plan should be developed.</p>\n<p>Orthodontic treatment requires patience and cooperation with the treating physician. If your child is reluctant about this process, there are various ways to gain their cooperation. For example, you can show them pictures of their favorite celebrities with straight, uniform teeth to encourage them. Additionally, you can discuss colored orthodontics, such as pink braces, which might make the treatment more appealing to them. Using creative methods to engage your child will help ensure their satisfaction in the future, as they will grow up with straight, healthy teeth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Is Orthodontic Treatment Possible at an Older Age?</h2>\n<p>Orthodontic treatment is possible at an older age, depending on factors such as the condition of the jawbone, its density, the level of skull growth, and the flexibility of the head tissues. If your physical conditions are suitable, orthodontic treatment can be effective. Even if you are beyond the optimal age, orthodontic treatment is still possible with special considerations. However, the results may take longer to achieve, which will be determined by a specialized dentist.</p>\n<h3>Which Type of Orthodontic Treatment is Suitable for Me?</h3>\n<p>There are various types of orthodontic treatments, each recommended for different cases. Here, we will briefly explain the two main types:</p>\n<p><strong>Fixed Orthodontics</strong></p>\n<p>In this method, a custom-made orthodontic device is placed inside the mouth based on the patient's oral conditions. The patient cannot remove this device. This type of treatment involves dietary restrictions because the device remains in the mouth throughout the treatment period.</p>\n<p><strong>Removable Orthodontics</strong></p>\n<p>In this method, the patient can remove the orthodontic device from their mouth, such as during eating. However, this should be done under the guidance of a specialist, as the device cannot be removed at any time. The treatment process should continue throughout the day and night.</p>\n<p>Orthodontic treatments are also categorized based on the type of device and the model of bracket installation, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Determining which type and material is suitable for you depends on various factors, including its application and cost. During the initial consultation, the specialist will recommend the best type of orthodontics for you, considering your specific conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Invisible Orthodontics for Those Concerned with the Appearance of Traditional Braces</h2>\n<p>Some individuals may not want their braces' wires and brackets to be visible for various reasons. A solution to this issue is invisible orthodontics, which is often preferred by professionals and people who frequently interact with others throughout the day. If you are concerned with the appearance of traditional braces, invisible orthodontics would be the best recommendation for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Orthodontic Cost</strong></p>\n<p>Orthodontic treatments come in various types, each with different costs. Some types are more expensive due to their additional benefits. Typically, dental orthodontics is performed on an entire jaw, meaning that it is not possible to accept the cost of orthodontics for a single crooked tooth. All the teeth of one jaw must be treated. However, single-jaw orthodontics can be an option instead of treating both jaws.</p>\n<p><strong>Finding the Best Orthodontist in Tehran</strong></p>\n<p>Orthodontics is highly sought after for its aesthetic benefits. To find the best doctor, start by reviewing their resume, education, and sample works. Examine the before and after photos of their orthodontic treatments to see the differences and determine if they meet your expectations. Additionally, ask their patients about their treatment experience, whether they achieved the desired results, and if they would recommend the doctor to others.</p>\n<p><strong>Orthodontics at Dr. Ebadian&rsquo;s Clinic</strong></p>\n<p>Orthodontics requires special accuracy and sensitivity and should be entrusted to specialists with extensive knowledge and proven results.
