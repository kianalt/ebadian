Soft tissues, such as gums and surrounding structures, play a crucial role in the beauty and health of your mouth. Our <strong>soft tissue management</strong> services at Dr. Ebadian&rsquo;s Dental Clinic help ensure not only the health of your gums but also enhance the beauty of your smile. These services include advanced treatments for gum issues and soft tissue concerns, which we will discuss in detail below.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>What Are Soft Tissues and Why Are They Important?</h2>\n<p>Soft tissues encompass the gums, mucous membranes, and connective tissues surrounding teeth and implants. These tissues not only support the teeth but also play a vital role in the overall aesthetics and health of the mouth. Healthy soft tissues contribute to your smile&rsquo;s appearance and help maintain the structure of your teeth and jaw. In fact, the quality and condition of these tissues can directly affect your dental health, comfort, and even self-esteem.</p>","description2":"<h2>Common Soft Tissue Problems</h2>\n<p>Various issues can affect soft tissues, including:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Gingivitis</strong>: This common condition usually arises from the accumulation of plaque and bacteria on the teeth. If untreated, gingivitis can progress to periodontitis, a more severe gum infection that may lead to tooth loss.</li>\n<li><strong>Gum Recession</strong>: Gum recession refers to the loss of gum tissue, which can expose the roots of the teeth and increase sensitivity to heat and cold. This condition can also negatively impact the aesthetics of your smile.</li>\n<li><strong>Soft Tissue Infections</strong>: Infections can spread rapidly and require immediate treatment. These infections may result from poor oral hygiene, physical injuries, or specific medical conditions. Prompt intervention is essential to prevent complications.</li>\n</ol>","description3":"<h2>Our Soft Tissue Management Services</h2>\n<p>Our soft tissue management services include advanced and effective methods for treating soft tissue issues. These services are designed to enhance both the function and aesthetics of your mouth:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong> Soft Tissue Grafting</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Soft tissue grafting is a procedure where tissue from one area of the body is transferred to another. This method improves the appearance of gums and supports implants. Soft tissue grafting can restore receded gums and enhance overall gum health. This technique is especially beneficial for individuals experiencing gum recession or undergoing dental implant procedures. By using the patient&rsquo;s own tissue, we minimize the risk of rejection and ensure a natural look.</p>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li><strong> Treatment of Gum Inflammation</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>The treatment for gum inflammation involves deep cleaning of the teeth and gums, along with the use of antiseptic medications. This method helps reduce inflammation and infection, improving the health of soft tissues. Regular dental visits for cleanings and check-ups can aid in the prevention of gum issues. By addressing inflammation early, we can help prevent more serious conditions that may arise.</p>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li><strong> Soft Tissue Stabilization</strong></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Techniques for stabilizing soft tissues help protect and support the tissues around implants. These methods prevent recession and infection, increasing the success rates of dental treatments. Utilizing specialized materials and innovative techniques can yield better results, ensuring that your implants and natural teeth remain healthy and functional.</p>\n<h3>Why Choose Soft Tissue Management?</h3>\n<p>Soft tissue management not only addresses existing issues but also prevents future problems. Choosing our services enables you to:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Maintain Your Smile&rsquo;s Aesthetic</strong>: By improving gum conditions, your smile will appear more natural and beautiful. A lovely smile can positively impact your self-confidence and overall quality of life.</li>\n<li><strong>Enhance Your Oral Health</strong>: Preventing soft tissue problems ensures the overall health of your mouth and teeth. Healthy soft tissues can help avert more serious issues, such as gum disease, which can have systemic effects on your health.</li>\n<li><strong>Enjoy Greater Comfort and Confidence</strong>: Treating soft tissue issues allows you to smile with more confidence. A beautiful smile can facilitate better social interactions and enhance your overall happiness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Key Tips for Maintaining Soft Tissues</h3>\n<p>To preserve the health of your soft tissues, consider the following key tips:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Oral Hygiene</strong>: Regular brushing and flossing are essential for maintaining soft tissue health. Additionally, using antiseptic mouthwash can help reduce bacteria and promote healing.</li>\n<li><strong>Regular Dental Check-ups</strong>: Routine dental examinations can help identify soft tissue problems early. These visits include deep cleanings and assessments of gum health, allowing for timely interventions when necessary.</li>\n<li><strong>Healthy Diet</strong>: Consuming foods rich in vitamins and minerals supports soft tissue strength. Fresh fruits and vegetables, dairy products, and low-fat proteins should be part of your diet to ensure optimal health.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Experience from the Professionals</h2>\n<p>At Dr. Ebadian&rsquo;s Dental Clinic, we prioritize the beauty and health of your smile.

When teeth develop decay, they require restoration. Restoration is a process in which the damaged or decayed part of the tooth is removed and replaced with specialized filling materials, such as composites, that can function like natural tooth tissue. These materials must possess certain characteristics to be suitable for replacing tooth structure. Tooth decay can vary in severity. Initially, decay affects a small portion of the tooth, which, if left untreated, can spread. If the decay advances, it may necessitate more complex treatments beyond simple restorative procedures.</p>\n<p>Each tooth has multiple surfaces and a volume, and decay typically affects a specific area on one side of the tooth. It is unnecessary to treat all surfaces; only the damaged portion needs restoration.</p>\n<p>Various treatments may be recommended for tooth damage, which we will discuss further in this article.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>","description2":"<h3 style=\"text-align: left;\">Restorative Treatments for Tooth Decay</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Restorative treatments for tooth decay can vary depending on the severity of the decay. If the decay is severe and reaches the root, a root canal treatment may be necessary. In some cases, if the damage is extensive, the tooth may need to be extracted and replaced with an implant. However, if the decay is in its early stages, it can be treated with restorative procedures using various materials.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Amalgam</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Tooth restoration using amalgam is a direct method. Amalgam is a flexible and strong material, though it is not tooth-colored and usually appears silver or black. Amalgam has the highest durability among restorative materials and is less expensive than composites. Its composition includes silver, tin, nickel, and mercury. Due to mercury's toxicity, the use of amalgam has been prohibited in some countries like those in Scandinavia. This treatment has become obsolete due to the health risks associated with mercury exposure.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Composite</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">Tooth restoration using composite is also a direct method. Composites are resin-based and paste-like materials made from various fillers, and they come in different types depending on their application. The color of composite can match the rest of a person&rsquo;s teeth and comes in various shades. You can consult with your dentist to determine which composite color is suitable for you. These materials have a natural appearance due to their tooth-like color. The lifespan of composites is shorter compared to other methods. Nowadays, ceramics are used as constituent materials in composites, increasing their durability and providing a more natural appearance. This treatment is the most popular and is considered the most appropriate method for tooth restoration. However, no treatment is completely definitive.</p>\n<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">Ceramic Resins</h4>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">In this method, an impression of the teeth is taken, and based on that impression, the laboratory creates replacement parts for the decaye portions of your teeth. If the inner part of the tooth is decayed and only the inner portion is filled with ceramic materials, it is called an inlay. If the decay is on the outer part of the tooth, it is called an onlay. This method is usually used for extensive restorations because it involves a larger portion of the tooth. These ceramic fillings match the color of the tooth and have a natural appearance.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">These materials can be applied using two methods: direct and indirect. Direct methods are performed directly by the dentist, while indirect methods, such as those involving composite resins, are done using a laboratory. In the indirect method, an impression of your tooth is taken, sent to the laboratory, and the restoration is fabricated for you.</p>\n<div class=\"flex-1 overflow-hidden\">\n<div class=\"h-full\">\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-otmzj-79elbk h-full\">\n<div class=\"react-scroll-to-bottom--css-otmzj-1n7m0yu\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-col text-sm md:pb-9\">\n<div class=\"w-full text-token-text-primary\" dir=\"auto\" data-testid=\"conversation-turn-5\" data-scroll-anchor=\"true\">\n<div class=\"py-2 juice:py-[18px] px-3 text-base md:px-4 m-auto md:px-5 lg:px-1 xl:px-5\">\n<div class=\"mx-auto flex flex-1 gap-3 text-base juice:gap-4 juice:md:gap-5 juice:lg:gap-6 md:max-w-3xl lg:max-w-[40rem] xl:max-w-[48rem]\">\n<div class=\"group/conversation-turn relative flex w-full min-w-0 flex-col agent-turn\">\n<div class=\"flex-col gap-1 md:gap-3\">\n<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] text-message flex flex-col items-start whitespace-pre-wrap break-words [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-5 juice:w-full juice:items-end overflow-x-auto gap-2\" dir=\"auto\" data-message-author-role=\"assistant\" data-message-id=\"4792b052-16fc-4f12-953b-edc7b3b39083\">\n<div class=\"flex w-full flex-col gap-1 juice:empty:hidden juice:first:pt-[3px]\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light\">\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2>&nbsp;</h2>\n<h2>Signs of Tooth Decay:</h2>\n<p>Tooth decay and cavities present various symptoms, and we have listed the most common ones below.

This procedure involves removing the decayed portion of the tooth root and replacing it with materials that function similarly to the original root. Root canal treatment entails removing the tooth's nerve, then cleaning and shaping the pulp canal space&mdash;the central area housing the tooth's nerves and blood vessels. After undergoing this treatment, the tooth can be used without the need for replacement methods, making it a therapeutic approach aimed at preserving and maintaining teeth with extensive decay and infection. When performed correctly and promptly, root canal treatment can help maintain the health of surrounding teeth.</p>\n<p>Root canal infections occur due to the entry and accumulation of bacteria around the tooth. As long as the tooth nerves are not completely destroyed, this condition is treatable. The dentist begins by eliminating the infection through the root canal procedure, then removes the dead tissues of the tooth. In cases where the infection is severe and has damaged the pulp canal, the dentist may need to extract the affected tooth.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mt-1 flex gap-3 empty:hidden juice:-ml-3\">\n<div class=\"items-center justify-start rounded-xl p-1 flex\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center\"><button class=\"rounded-lg text-token-text-secondary hover:bg-token-main-surface-secondary\"></button><button class=\"rounded-lg text-token-text-secondary hover:bg-token-main-surface-secondary\"></button><button class=\"rounded-lg text-token-text-secondary hover:bg-token-main-surface-secondary\"></button>\n<div class=\"flex items-center pb-0.5 juice:pb-0\">&nbsp;</div>\n<span class=\"\" data-state=\"closed\"><button id=\"radix-:rje:\" class=\"cursor-pointer rounded-md px-1 text-token-text-secondary h-[30px] hover:bg-token-main-surface-secondary\" type=\"button\" aria-haspopup=\"menu\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-state=\"closed\"></button></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>","description2":"<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] text-message flex flex-col items-start whitespace-pre-wrap break-words [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-5 juice:w-full juice:items-end overflow-x-auto gap-2\" dir=\"auto\" data-message-author-role=\"assistant\" data-message-id=\"cf8a99ea-3da5-4828-b890-b10cfe423ee5\">\n<div class=\"flex w-full flex-col gap-1 juice:empty:hidden juice:first:pt-[3px]\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light\">\n<p><strong>Am I a Candidate for Root Canal Treatment?</strong></p>\n<p>Fine cracks, trauma, impact, and decay can cause an infection in a tooth&rsquo;s root.

However, fractures or decay can allow bacteria to penetrate and cause various diseases. Bacterial accumulation in the pulp and its spread to the tooth&rsquo;s root can lead to conditions such as gum infection and abscesses.</p>\n<p>If dental treatments are not performed correctly, it can result in problems in the mouth and teeth. Using non-hygienic methods or low-quality tools can lead to infections. Ensuring the use of high-quality and standardized tools in treatments such as orthodontics and veneers helps prevent damage and contributes to the longevity of tooth repairs.</p>\n<p><strong>Three Important Factors in Causing Tooth Infection:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Cracks in Tooth Enamel:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Factors like inadequate water intake, diabetes, etc., can increase the risk of oral infections. Children and elderly individuals are more prone to root canal infections due to often prioritizing oral hygiene less.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Poor Oral Hygiene:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Not brushing teeth after meals is a significant factor in oral diseases. Regular brushing can eliminate over 50% of plaque and dental contamination.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>High-Impact Sports:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sports like boxing, hockey, and taekwondo can cause dental injuries. Using mouthguards during sports activities helps maintain dental health.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>High Sugar Intake:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Excessive sugar weakens the immune system and damages tooth enamel, leading to inflammation and infection.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Methods of Diagnosing Root Canal Infection</h3>\n<p>Diagnosing the extent and severity of a root canal infection is the responsibility of the dentist. When symptoms are unclear, radiography may be used to show the precise location and extent of the infection. Other diagnostic methods include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Percussion and Palpation:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Gently tapping the tooth and surrounding tissues or applying pressure to check for sensitivity, pain, or swelling.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Thermal Testing:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using hot or cold stimuli to assess sensitivity and determine if the tooth&rsquo;s nerve is affected.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Electric Pulp Testing (EPT):</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Using a small electrical current to assess the vitality of the tooth&rsquo;s pulp, indicating whether the nerve is functioning properly.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Clinical Examination:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Visual inspection of the tooth for signs of decay, discoloration, swelling, or other indications of infection.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Medical History and Symptoms Analysis:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Evaluating the patient&rsquo;s medical history and discussing symptoms to gather information that may contribute to the diagnosis.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Cold and Hot Testing</h3>\n<p>This common method evaluates root canal infections. Infected teeth with vital nerves will react to cold and hot temperatures. The level and duration of pain indicate the infection's severity. Sometimes, pain is induced by applying heat to a live tooth and relieved by cooling it down.</p>\n<h3>Electric Pulp Testing</h3>\n<p>By applying a weak electrical current to the tooth&rsquo;s surface, the extent of damage to the pulp can be measured. If the patient feels the electric current, it indicates that the tooth nerves are not completely damaged, and the injury is potentially reversible.</p>\n<p>Diagnosing this condition requires specialized procedures best performed by dental specialists, who can provide more definitive treatments.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mt-1 flex gap-3 empty:hidden juice:-ml-3\">\n<div class=\"items-center justify-start rounded-xl p-1 flex\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center\"><span class=\"\" data-state=\"closed\"><button id=\"radix-:rkf:\" class=\"cursor-pointer rounded-md px-1 text-token-text-secondary h-[30px] hover:bg-token-main-surface-secondary\" type=\"button\" aria-haspopup=\"menu\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-state=\"closed\"></button></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>"},"insertDate":"2024-06-09T11:16:08.960Z","updateDate":"2024-08-19T07:57:48.895Z"},{"isFeatured":false,"relatedContents":[],"relatedBlogs":[],"_id":"66658e2fdcfc0403ffd7b8fe","contentType":"service-en","values":{"image":"/media/image/2bd742c9-4b2a-4e66-9f1c-da215df705ed.jpeg","homeImage":"/media/image/4439bad8-4aa9-4635-950d-333c43d68a8b.png","title":"Gum surgery","slug":"gum-surgery","brief":"Gums play a crucial role in oral health and are essential in maintaining and enhancing the beauty of your smile.

Or when you talk and smile, your gums are overly exposed, causing a drop in your confidence. These are signs that you might need gum surgery. Some of the most common reasons for needing gum surgery include:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gum Diseases:</strong> Such as gingivitis (gum inflammation) or periodontitis (advanced gum disease), which damage the gum tissue and the bone around the teeth.</li>\n<li><strong>Excessive Gum Exposure:</strong> If your gums are overly covering your teeth or are too exposed when you smile, gum surgery can correct this.</li>\n<li><strong>Prevention of Further Damage:</strong> If your gums have receded or detached from the teeth, gum surgery can prevent further damage and maintain the health of your mouth and teeth.</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"mt-1 flex gap-3 empty:hidden juice:-ml-3\">\n<div class=\"items-center justify-start rounded-xl p-1 flex\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center\">&nbsp;</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<h2><strong>Types of Gum Surgeries</strong></h2>\n<p>Depending on the type of gum problem, gum surgeries are divided into two main categories: therapeutic and cosmetic gum surgeries.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Therapeutic Gum Surgeries:</strong></li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Flap Surgery:</strong> This method is usually used to treat periodontitis. In this surgery, the gums are lifted from the teeth, and after thoroughly cleaning the plaque and bacteria from the tooth roots, they are repositioned.</li>\n<li><strong>Gum Grafting:</strong> This method involves taking gum tissue from other parts of the mouth or using synthetic materials to cover and strengthen the damaged gum areas.</li>\n<li><strong>Bone Grafting:</strong> Used to rebuild jawbone lost due to disease or trauma. This surgery can help preserve and strengthen the structure of the teeth.</li>\n</ul>\n<li><strong>Cosmetic Gum Surgeries:</strong></li>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gingivectomy:</strong> This method is used to reshape and align the gums, improving the appearance of your smile.

It is one of the most popular dental treatments due to its aesthetic and therapeutic benefits. This treatment is recommended when teeth are irregularly positioned next to each other. Orthodontic treatment is not a quick process, and although there are faster methods to correct misaligned teeth, orthodontics is considered the most thorough and systematic approach. One of the key advantages of orthodontics over other treatments is that it corrects dental malocclusions naturally, without the need for cutting the teeth or using foreign substances. For example, using composites or laminates to correct dental irregularities involves trimming the teeth and placing a foreign material on them.</p>","description2":"<h2>How is Orthodontics Done?</h2>\n<p>To determine if you are a suitable candidate for orthodontics, a specialist must perform a diagnosis. Initially, it is important to identify your specific dental issue. If you have dental malformations or concerns about tooth color, laminates might be the best treatment for you since orthodontics does not change the shape or color of teeth, but rather improves their alignment. Therefore, correctly diagnosing your problem is the first step. If you have misaligned teeth and also issues with dental malformations or tooth color, a combination treatment involving orthodontics and laminates, or orthodontics and bleaching (to correct tooth color), may be necessary. Consult your specialist dentist for the best advice.</p>\n<p>If you suspect that you have crooked or misaligned teeth that require orthodontic treatment, your first step should be to visit an orthodontic or specialized dental clinic. After discussing your concerns with a specialist, the orthodontic treatment process will begin. The specific treatment plan will vary for each person.</p>\n<p>Initially, the orthodontic specialist will examine your teeth and prescribe radiology images. These radiographs will provide a comprehensive set of images needed for assessment, including views of all teeth, individual teeth, canines, and posterior teeth.</p>\n<p>Once the radiography is complete, the specialist will determine the appropriate type of orthodontic treatment based on the examination. For instance, you might be prescribed &ldquo;fixed orthodontic treatment.&rdquo;</p>\n<p>The next step involves creating orthodontic molds of your teeth, which are then sent to a laboratory to fabricate the brackets. Orthodontic brackets are essential tools for the treatment, helping to align and straighten your teeth.</p>\n<p>Finally, the orthodontic brackets are installed on your teeth.</p>\n<p>After the installation, periodic checkups are required to monitor the braces and the progress of the treatment. Post-orthodontic care is crucial and often more important than the in-clinic treatment stages. Orthodontic treatment is a long-term process that requires patience. Following the specialist&rsquo;s instructions is vital for success. For example, using dental floss and brushing after every meal are essential practices during this period. Ignoring the doctor&rsquo;s advice can negatively impact your treatment plan.</p>","description3":"<h2>Orthodontics for Children</h2>\n<p>Orthodontics is highly suitable for children who are in the growth phase and exhibit signs of dental irregularities. It is beneficial for children to address any irregularities in their teeth as early as possible. Young children should visit a specialist for a dental examination, and if needed, a comprehensive treatment plan should be developed.</p>\n<p>Orthodontic treatment requires patience and cooperation with the treating physician. If your child is reluctant about this process, there are various ways to gain their cooperation. For example, you can show them pictures of their favorite celebrities with straight, uniform teeth to encourage them. Additionally, you can discuss colored orthodontics, such as pink braces, which might make the treatment more appealing to them. Using creative methods to engage your child will help ensure their satisfaction in the future, as they will grow up with straight, healthy teeth.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Is Orthodontic Treatment Possible at an Older Age?</h2>\n<p>Orthodontic treatment is possible at an older age, depending on factors such as the condition of the jawbone, its density, the level of skull growth, and the flexibility of the head tissues. If your physical conditions are suitable, orthodontic treatment can be effective. Even if you are beyond the optimal age, orthodontic treatment is still possible with special considerations. However, the results may take longer to achieve, which will be determined by a specialized dentist.</p>\n<h3>Which Type of Orthodontic Treatment is Suitable for Me?</h3>\n<p>There are various types of orthodontic treatments, each recommended for different cases. Here, we will briefly explain the two main types:</p>\n<p><strong>Fixed Orthodontics</strong></p>\n<p>In this method, a custom-made orthodontic device is placed inside the mouth based on the patient's oral conditions. The patient cannot remove this device. This type of treatment involves dietary restrictions because the device remains in the mouth throughout the treatment period.</p>\n<p><strong>Removable Orthodontics</strong></p>\n<p>In this method, the patient can remove the orthodontic device from their mouth, such as during eating. However, this should be done under the guidance of a specialist, as the device cannot be removed at any time. The treatment process should continue throughout the day and night.</p>\n<p>Orthodontic treatments are also categorized based on the type of device and the model of bracket installation, each with its advantages and disadvantages. Determining which type and material is suitable for you depends on various factors, including its application and cost. During the initial consultation, the specialist will recommend the best type of orthodontics for you, considering your specific conditions.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<h2>Invisible Orthodontics for Those Concerned with the Appearance of Traditional Braces</h2>\n<p>Some individuals may not want their braces' wires and brackets to be visible for various reasons. A solution to this issue is invisible orthodontics, which is often preferred by professionals and people who frequently interact with others throughout the day. If you are concerned with the appearance of traditional braces, invisible orthodontics would be the best recommendation for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Orthodontic Cost</strong></p>\n<p>Orthodontic treatments come in various types, each with different costs. Some types are more expensive due to their additional benefits. Typically, dental orthodontics is performed on an entire jaw, meaning that it is not possible to accept the cost of orthodontics for a single crooked tooth. All the teeth of one jaw must be treated. However, single-jaw orthodontics can be an option instead of treating both jaws.</p>\n<p><strong>Finding the Best Orthodontist in Tehran</strong></p>\n<p>Orthodontics is highly sought after for its aesthetic benefits. To find the best doctor, start by reviewing their resume, education, and sample works. Examine the before and after photos of their orthodontic treatments to see the differences and determine if they meet your expectations. Additionally, ask their patients about their treatment experience, whether they achieved the desired results, and if they would recommend the doctor to others.</p>\n<p><strong>Orthodontics at Dr. Ebadian&rsquo;s Clinic</strong></p>\n<p>Orthodontics requires special accuracy and sensitivity and should be entrusted to specialists with extensive knowledge and proven results. At Dr. Ebadian&rsquo;s specialized dental clinic, orthodontics is a highly important treatment section.

However, for this procedure to be viable, the density of your jawbone in the surgical area must be sufficient. If necessary, bone grafting may be performed, often referred to as a bone graft implant.</p>\n<h3>Procedure</h3>\n<p>The implant is inserted into the jawbone by a specialized surgeon. The dental replacement process involves several stages, including the placement of the implant base and subsequent steps such as molding and covering. Parts of the implant are placed inside the jawbone, acting like a natural tooth root. After this, a dental prosthesis or cover is attached to it. The combination of these components mimics the function and feel of a natural tooth, providing a healthy and functional replacement.</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>","description2":"<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] text-message flex flex-col items-start whitespace-pre-wrap break-words [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-5 juice:w-full juice:items-end overflow-x-auto gap-2\" dir=\"auto\" data-message-author-role=\"assistant\" data-message-id=\"587616e0-5569-4de7-9dac-ec9e20c1afec\">\n<div class=\"flex w-full flex-col gap-1 juice:empty:hidden juice:first:pt-[3px]\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light\">\n<h3>Types of Implants</h3>\n<p>Different types of implants are used based on the patient's condition:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Single Tooth Replacement</strong>: If you lose one tooth, a single implant can be placed.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multiple Adjacent Teeth</strong>: If you lose two adjacent teeth, two implant bases are required. For three or more teeth, fewer bases might be needed, depending on the specific situation. This is known as an implant for adjacent teeth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Complete Jaw Replacement</strong>: For patients who lose all their teeth in one or both jaws, the treatment options depend on the dentist's diagnosis and the density of the jawbone:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>A combination of artificial teeth and several implant bases.</li>\n<li>A smaller number of implant bases with covers according to the number of teeth.</li>\n<li>Denture treatment alone.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Dental implants provide a reliable and functional solution for tooth replacement, acting much like natural teeth. Whether replacing a single tooth, multiple teeth, or an entire jaw, dental implants can restore both the functionality and aesthetics of your smile. Consulting with a specialized surgeon will help determine the best treatment plan based on individual needs and jawbone density.</p>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<h3>Am I a Candidate for a Dental Implant?</h3>\n<p>A suitable candidate for a dental implant is someone who has good oral and general health. The most crucial requirement is to have healthy gums without any diseases. Since the implant is placed into the jawbone, having adequate and healthy bone tissue is essential.</p>\n<p>If you have any of the following conditions, dental implant surgery may not be recommended:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Weak immune system</li>\n<li>Age under 16</li>\n<li>Specific diseases such as cancer and hepatitis</li>\n<li>Incomplete skull bone growth and incomplete tooth development</li>\n<li>Pregnancy (implant surgery should only be performed with a doctor&rsquo;s approval during pregnancy)</li>\n<li>Uncontrolled diabetes (controlled diabetes through medication or diet is usually not a problem)</li>\n<li>History of severe heart issues, heart attack, or heart surgery (consult with a cardiovascular specialist before considering implant surgery)</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Advantages of Dental Implants</h3>\n<p>Despite the high cost, dental implants offer numerous benefits, such as:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Comfort and Practicality</strong>: Implants provide a natural chewing ability and comfort, making them more satisfying compared to fixed bridges or removable dentures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Durability</strong>: With proper care and attention to hygiene, dental implants can last a lifetime without the need for replacement.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Preservation of Other Teeth</strong>: Implant treatment does not require sacrificing adjacent teeth, unlike some other dental procedures.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Health Benefits</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Gum Health</strong>: Implants fill the cavity left by a missing tooth, preventing bacterial infiltration and gum disease.</li>\n<li><strong>Preventing Dental Issues</strong>: Implants reduce the risk of inflammation and gum infections by providing a quick and effective tooth replacement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Aesthetic Appeal</strong>: Implants look very similar to natural teeth, maintaining the beauty of your smile and boosting confidence, especially when replacing front teeth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Improved Pronunciation</strong>: Missing teeth can affect your ability to pronounce words correctly. Implants help restore proper speech.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Enhanced Comfort and Digestion</strong>: Implants allow you to chew food more effectively, preventing digestive issues and offering greater comfort compared to dentures.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>&nbsp;</h3>\n<p>Dental implants are a superior method for tooth replacement due to their durability, health benefits, aesthetic appeal, and comfort. While they come at a higher cost, the advantages they offer make them a worthwhile investment for many patients. Always consult with your dental specialist to determine the best treatment plan based on your individual health and dental condition.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div class=\"mt-1 flex gap-3 empty:hidden juice:-ml-3\">\n<div class=\"items-center justify-start rounded-xl p-1 flex\">\n<div class=\"flex items-center\"><span class=\"\" data-state=\"closed\"><button id=\"radix-:rd8:\" class=\"cursor-pointer rounded-md px-1 text-token-text-secondary h-[30px] hover:bg-token-main-surface-secondary\" type=\"button\" aria-haspopup=\"menu\" aria-expanded=\"false\" data-state=\"closed\"></button></span></div>\n</div>\n</div>","description3":"<div class=\"flex flex-grow flex-col max-w-full\">\n<div class=\"min-h-[20px] text-message flex flex-col items-start whitespace-pre-wrap break-words [.text-message+&amp;]:mt-5 juice:w-full juice:items-end overflow-x-auto gap-2\" dir=\"auto\" data-message-author-role=\"assistant\" data-message-id=\"29cff985-3fc6-4a9e-a53a-f52d5904149c\">\n<div class=\"flex w-full flex-col gap-1 juice:empty:hidden juice:first:pt-[3px]\">\n<div class=\"markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light\">\n<h3>Advantages of Dental Implants</h3>\n<p>Compared to other tooth replacement methods, dental implants cause minimal damage. However, using substandard implants or having a dentist with insufficient expertise can lead to complications. Some potential disadvantages include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Implant Fracture</strong>: Although rare, some implant brands may break if subjected to high pressure or heavy impact. Unfortunately, a fractured implant cannot be repaired.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Implant Coating Detachment</strong>: While the implant body itself remains fixed, excessive pressure can cause the coating to come off. If this happens, you should see your dentist promptly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Infection</strong>: Infection during implant treatment is rare. However, improper implant placement might necessitate removal by the dentist. Pain or sensitivity might be mistaken for an infection by patients.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Loosening of the Implant Screw</strong>: Though uncommon, issues such as teeth grinding, eating hard foods, or biting on hard objects can cause the implant screw to loosen.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Post-Implant Care: Six Key Points</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Avoid Manipulating the Surgical Area</strong>: Refrain from touching or disturbing the surgical site after the procedure.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dietary Precautions</strong>: Avoid chewing hard foods and fruits for a month following the implant surgery.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Medication Adherence</strong>: Follow the prescribed medication regimen, as it is tailored to your condition and aids in the success of the treatment.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Oral Hygiene</strong>: Keep the surgical site clean by brushing with physiological saline after each meal.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Regular Check-Ups</strong>: Attend all scheduled dentist appointments to prevent potential issues such as implant infection.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Use Approved Oral Care Products</strong>: If recommended by your dentist, use mouthwash, a toothbrush, and dental floss specifically designed for implants to reduce infection risk.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Considering Gum Surgery</h3>\n<p>Gum surgery is necessary when gum tissue cannot be treated with conventional methods. The primary reasons include gum infections and periodontitis.</p>\n<h4>Types of Gum Surgery</h4>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Flap Surgery</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Reduces gum pockets formed due to infections or inflammation.</li>\n<li><strong>Procedure</strong>: The dentist makes an incision, removes the infection, and then stitches the gum back up. This surgery can also address bone defects or loss.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Crown Lengthening Surgery</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Corrects excessive gum tissue growth, known as a &ldquo;gummy smile.&rdquo;</li>\n<li><strong>Procedure</strong>: Excess gum tissue is removed to enhance the natural appearance of teeth.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Soft Tissue Graft Surgery</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Used when the gum line is higher than usual.</li>\n<li><strong>Procedure</strong>: Soft tissues from the palate or roof of the mouth are grafted onto the affected areas to improve appearance and protect tooth roots.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Gum Restoration Surgery</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Addresses gum recession.</li>\n<li><strong>Procedure</strong>: After removing any infection, stimulating proteins are applied to encourage new tissue growth.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Bone Grafting</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Replaces lost jawbone tissue.</li>\n<li><strong>Methods</strong>:\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Autogenous Bone Graft</strong>: Bone is taken from another part of the patient&rsquo;s body.</li>\n<li><strong>Allograft</strong>: Uses bone or soft tissue from another person, or artificial bone from a laboratory.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Application</strong>: Often necessary for patients with insufficient bone density for implants.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Laser Therapy</strong>:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Purpose</strong>: Removes plaque and bacteria causing gum inflammation and bleeding.</li>\n<li><strong>Procedure</strong>: Uses laser light to clean the root surfaces and remove bacteria without cutting or tissue removal.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Postoperative Gum Care</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Dietary Precautions</strong>: Avoid hot, spicy, and crunchy foods; opt for liquid foods like soup.</li>\n<li><strong>Cold Therapy</strong>: Use an ice pack immediately after surgery to reduce inflammation.</li>\n<li><strong>Cold Drinks</strong>: Help cool the mouth and reduce gum inflammation.</li>\n<li><strong>Medication</strong>: Only use prescribed pain relievers.</li>\n<li><strong>Wound Care</strong>: Avoid touching, brushing, or chewing near the bandaged wounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Physical Activity</strong>: Minimize physical exertion and avoid hot weather or intense sunlight.</li>\n<li><strong>Sensitivity Management</strong>: You may experience sensitivity to stimuli like toothpaste or hot and cold food. If sensitivities persist, inform your dentist.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Proper postoperative care is crucial to prevent infections and ensure a successful recovery.

In other words, cosmetic dentistry is a branch of dentistry that focuses on improving both the function and appearance of a person's teeth. Any actions taken to achieve healthy and attractive teeth, such as bleaching, cleaning, and polishing, fall under the category of cosmetic dentistry.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","description2":"<h2>Teeth Whitening for Aesthetic Purposes</h2>\n<h6>Teeth whitening is an effective method for enhancing the appearance of teeth. Bleaching, which can be done both at home and in a clinic, is one such method. When performed in a dental clinic, there are different approaches for live teeth (completely healthy teeth) and non-living teeth (damaged teeth).</h6>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>which include:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Whitening Live Teeth in the Dental Clinic:</strong></p>\n<p>At Dr. Ebadian&rsquo;s clinic, the procedure begins by applying a thick 40% hydrogen peroxide solution to the teeth for a few minutes. Next, the teeth are exposed to laser light or special lamps, which enhances the effectiveness of the whitening agent. This teeth whitening process should be repeated 3 to 4 times, with a one-week interval between each session.</p>\n<p><strong>Whitening Non-Vital or Restored Teeth in the Clinic:</strong></p>\n<p>For this procedure, a cavity is created in the tooth to accommodate the whitening gel. The gel is left inside the tooth for one hour before being removed. Similar to the treatment for live teeth, this method should be repeated 3 to 4 times, with a one-week interval between each session, to achieve visible results.</p>\n<p><strong>Dental Cleaning</strong></p>\n<p>The buildup of plaque and bacteria on teeth can lead to stains and discoloration. Dental cleaning involves a dentist removing plaque and debris from the teeth using specialized cleaning tools. This process helps reduce bacterial penetration into the teeth and lowers the risk of tooth decay.</p>\n<p>However, dental cleaning cannot remove internal stains. For deep stains, other methods such as bleaching are necessary to enhance the appearance of your teeth.</p>\n<p>Dental cleaning can be performed in two ways: manually or with an ultrasonic device. To learn more about the dental cleaning process, its side effects, and aftercare, please visit the dental cleaning page.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Tooth Polishing</strong></p>\n<p>Another process that enhances the beauty of teeth is polishing. The dentist begins by cleaning the surface of the teeth with a brush, then removes plaque and tartar using a special paste called prophylaxis paste, resulting in a smooth surface. As shown in the picture below (before and after tooth polishing), this method is suitable only for teeth with surface stains. Tooth polishing has various types and serves different purposes, including:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Surface polishing</li>\n<li>Therapeutic polishing</li>\n<li>Cosmetic polishing</li>\n<li>Selective polishing</li>\n</ul>\n<p><strong>Types of Dental Cosmetic Procedures</strong></p>\n<p>Ultimately, all procedures performed in a dental clinic aim to beautify your teeth and smile, such as orthodontics, laminates, implants, and more. Dr. Ebadian&rsquo;s dental clinic can help you achieve the most beautiful smiles in the shortest possible time.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>","description3":"<p><strong>Laminates and Their Lifespan</strong></p>\n<p>Laminates are a popular dental covering that has proven effective for many years. Many people worldwide use this cosmetic dental procedure to achieve beautiful, white, and well-shaped teeth. Laminates can effectively conceal cracks, misshapen teeth, and yellow or black stains, enhancing the overall appearance of your teeth. However, if someone is not satisfied with the results of laminates or wishes to remove them for any reason, what should be done? The first thought that comes to mind is probably removing the dental laminates.</p>\n<p>Since laminates are external additions to the body, they have a limited lifespan. Although this lifespan can sometimes approach ten years, laminates may deteriorate over time, diminishing the teeth's appearance. The lifespan of laminates depends on numerous factors, with the precision of their fabrication being just one of them.</p>\n<p>The most crucial factor in extending the lifespan of laminates is proper care. This includes avoiding substances such as cigarettes and alcohol, not biting hard materials, refraining from consuming very hot or cold drinks, and regularly using a toothbrush and dental floss, ideally two to three times a day. However, even with these precautions, laminates can still encounter problems. Consequently, many people wonder if laminates cause tooth decay.</p>\n<p>The truth is that tooth decay does not solely depend on the presence of laminates. Some people mistakenly believe that laminates are as strong as natural teeth and test them by biting hard objects. Laminates are primarily a cosmetic dental procedure that makes your teeth look natural but does not necessarily enhance their strength. Therefore, if you have used laminates incorrectly, the issue may not be with the laminates themselves. It is also normal for laminates to chip or decay after a few years.</p>"},"insertDate":"2024-06-02T13:41:17.338Z","updateDate":"2024-07-08T09:16:36.736Z"}]},"__N_SSG":true}
